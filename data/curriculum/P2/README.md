## Competence-Based Approach

Each theme contains specific **competences** that children should develop. These are genuine abilities demonstrating understanding and measurable skills, emphasizing transfer of learning rather than mere knowledge accumulation.

## Teaching Methodology

- **Child-Centered**: Children are active participants in learning
- **Theme-Based**: Content organized around themes familiar to children
- **Play-Based**: Learning through games, songs, and activities
- **Inclusive**: Caters for all learners including those with special needs
- **First Language**: Uses child's first/familiar language as medium of instruction

## How to Use These Files

### For Teachers
1. Review the theme content in mathematics.json and english.json
2. Select competences appropriate for your learners
3. Design activities and lessons around the theme topics
4. Assess learners' achievement of competences

### For Parents/Guardians
- Understand what your child is learning each term
- Support learning at home using theme-related activities
- Follow children's progress through competence development

### For Curriculum Developers
- Use as basis for detailed teacher guides
- Develop assessment tools
- Create resource materials aligned to competences

## Key Features

✓ **Integrated Learning** - Multiple subjects linked through themes  
✓ **Relevant Content** - Themes based on children's real-life experiences  
✓ **Skill Development** - Focus on practical competences not just knowledge  
✓ **Inclusive Design** - Adaptable for diverse learner needs  
✓ **Flexible Implementation** - Teachers can adapt activities as needed  

## P2 Curriculum Duration

- **Typical Duration**: Full academic year (approximately 30-36 weeks)
- **Terms**: Usually divided into 2-3 terms
- **Weekly Periods**: Allocated across different learning areas

## Transition Notes

Children in P2 are building on P1 foundations. They should already have:
- Basic literacy and numeracy skills
- Familiarity with thematic organization
- Experience in collaborative learning

P2 prepares them for P3, the final year of thematic curriculum before transitioning to subject-based learning in P4.

## Assessment in P2

Assessment is **continuous and competence-based**:
- Observe children's performance during activities
- Record evidence of competence achievement
- Use checklists provided in each theme section
- Celebrate progress and provide support for struggling learners

## Special Considerations

- **Language**: Uses first/familiar language for instruction; English taught as subject
- **Inclusive Education**: Activities should be adapted for learners with special needs
- **Resources**: Can use local materials and community resources
- **Flexibility**: Teachers adjust timing based on learner progress
